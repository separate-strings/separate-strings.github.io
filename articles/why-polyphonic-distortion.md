Distortion created the rock sound. It started from a technical limitation: When playing the guitar amps too loud, the clipping of the waves two very distinced effects:

1. <b>Compression:</b> by chopping the peaks, the sound becomes less dynamic and the instruments "sings" more
2. <b>Change of harmonic content:</b> new overtones and undertones which partly are harmonically related and make the sound richer and partly are disharmonic and bring the dirtyness.

Musicians learned to use these sounds to express the spirit of 1968 revolution. The compression made the guitar sing and scream like a solo instrument and the interferences made the chords sound harsh and heavy. Since then, the distortion effect is associated with rock music. The effect is not mainly achieved by overdriving amps any more, but with circuits and software that imitates it. And distortion is used in any kind of music, not only for the desperate scream of the revolution but also for screams of joy in the church, for erotic heat, romantic melodies, space loops and experimental music.
But even 30 years after its availability, its still not common to use the clean compression effect polyphonically!
Standard distortion used with only one string is very flexible and turns the guitar into a singing solo instrument. The clipping causes a compression and turns the naturally quickly fading string into a sustaining note. Plus, there are more overtones, so the sound can be shaped much richer with filters.

<i>But what if you want to play a two or three voice solo with the same sound?</i>
With a mix of strings, distortion does something very different: Its a simple mathematical fact that any changes of a waveform that contains a mix of two frequencies produces the fundamental bass which contains both of those frequencies as harmonics. This effect and the resulting new frequencies are called interference. Interference can be harmonically related, making the sound richer, or unrelated, making it dirty. In musical terms, this means that depending on the intervals you play, a chord sounds fat or disharmonic. Octaves and quint (?) work well, smaller intervals become increasingly disturbing. Every guitar player using distortion knows this well, at least intuitively. Its what limits the harmonies used in standard guitar rock music. And its what makes musicians that use more sophisticated chords not use distortion! Although they may like the sustaining and enriching effect that distortion has on single strings!

A Polyphonic Guitar offers the nice aspect of distortion for all musical styles without any harmonic limitations. It also makes solo work cleaner, because even the most clean guitar players cannot avoid that sometimes the transition between notes create interference.
