Single String Processing = Poly-Processing (so far called Hexaphonic or Polyphonic Guitars)
this site is dedicated to a about 40 years old effort to improve musical instruments, so far mainly guitars, by treating each string instead of the sum of them. there are many reasons to make this effort - we want to explain them here!
for a composer its normal to give each of his melody line a different sound, by selecting an instrument for it. for the church organ, hundreds of years ago, they invented to have several manuals for the same purpose. so why should we not be able to play several voices on any modern instrument? But it starts much simpler: even if we use the same sound for all the notes we are playing, we need to process each note separately, below we will explain why.
technically, this starts with a pickup under each string, an instrument cable with a wire for each string and an amplifier with as many channels as there are strings.
this site is owned by the community that helps to create it, it needs to stay away from comercial interests, which is not easy, since we basically explain the musical use of existing and dreamed-of equipment...

## Figures (for images or video)

### One Up

<figure>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif"><img src="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif"></a>
	<figcaption>Image caption.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="half">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.gif"><img src="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif"></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.gif"><img src="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif"></a>
	<figcaption>Two images.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="third">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="{{ site.url }}/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/900x450.gif">
	<figcaption>Three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
